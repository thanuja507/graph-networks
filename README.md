# Graph Algorithms Project
This project focuses on implementing graph algorithms and building a graph network. Additionally, it involves creating a profession and title dictionary. The main objective is to code and implement test cases for various graph algorithms, including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, and strongly connected components. Below are the details of each component:

# Graph Network Implementation
Build a graph network using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
Implement graph algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, and strongly connected components on the constructed graph network.

# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python (or any language of choice)
Version Control: Git
Documentation: Markdown for README.md

# Setup Instructions
Clone the repository from GitHub.
Install any necessary dependencies.
Run the test cases to validate the functionality of implemented algorithms.
Explore the profession and title dictionary for reference and usage.

# Usage
Utilize the implemented graph algorithms for various applications such as pathfinding, network analysis, and optimization.
Refer to the profession and title dictionary for categorizing and managing professional titles efficiently.
